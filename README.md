# WaitingRoomSimulator

## To-Do
* We need to have waiting room music play once you enter the waiting room. This can be either a local media file or an web resource, whatever works for the development team.
* The option to play another game like Street Dice or Rock, Paper, Scissors would be a good way to kill time keeping in mind the exit criteria for Waiting Room Simulator itself is met in the final while loop.
* Check the time condition to be valid regardless of whether the player is in the waiting loop or not.
